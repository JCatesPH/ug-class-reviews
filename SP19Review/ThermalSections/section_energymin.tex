One of the primary advantages of Legendre Transformations is the elimination of extensive parameters based on the system setup.

            \toprule
            Name       & Reservoir & Minimized Cond. & Usage  \\
            \midrule
            Helmholtz  & $T_r$       & $T_{sys} = T_r$   & Many systems can be approximated as being in contact with the temperature reservoir of its surroundings. \\
            \midrule
            Enthalpy   & $P_r$       & $P_{sys} = P_r$   & Most systems have the atmospheric pressure as a reservoir but also ambient temperature, so the Gibbs is more useful in general. \\
            \midrule
            Gibbs      & $P_r,T_r$   & $P_{sys} = P_r, T_{sys} = T_r$  & This is the situation of most experiments in contact with the atmosphere.
